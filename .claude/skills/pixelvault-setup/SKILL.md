# PixelVault Setup

Install and configure the PixelVault CLI for image hosting.

## Steps

### 1. Check if CLI is installed

```bash
which pixelvault
```

If not found, install it:

```bash
npm install -g pixelvault-cli
```

### 2. Check if already configured

```bash
pixelvault whoami --json
```

If this succeeds, the user is already set up. Show them their current config and ask if they want to reconfigure.

### 3. Configure authentication

Ask the user which option they prefer:

**Option A — Existing API key:**
If the user already has a PixelVault API key, set it directly:

```bash
pixelvault config set api_key <their-key>
```

**Option B — Environment variable:**
For CI/CD or headless usage, suggest adding to their shell profile:

```bash
export PIXELVAULT_API_KEY=pv_live_xxx
```

**Option C — Create new account:**
If the user doesn't have an account, register:

```bash
pixelvault register
```

This will prompt for email and password, create the account, and auto-save the API key.

### 4. Verify

Confirm setup works:

```bash
pixelvault whoami
```

Should show email, project ID, and masked API key.

### 5. Done

Tell the user they're ready to upload images with `/pixelvault-upload <file>`.
